Currently, most of the texts are historical in nature (chronicles, biographical collections, geographical treatises and gazetteers, adab, and thematic dictionaries). If you are interested in having other genres and forms, please, get in touch with us.\r\n\r\nMost of the texts derive from open-access online collections of premodern and modern Arabic texts such as [http://shamela.ws/](http://shamela.ws/) and [http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/](http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/) (These texts have `Shamela+NUMBER` and `Shia+NUMBER`; some texts are coming from _al-Jāmiʿ al-kabīr_, which has been published on an external HDD and is not available online (`JK+NUMBER`). Initial metadata from these collections is preserved at the beginning of each file.\r\n\r\nCurrently uploaded texts have been automatically converted from their initial formats into a `mARkdown` format—a flavor of `markdown` for tagging premodern Arabic text. All of our texts require further editing to properly tag their structures. A detailed description of the `mARkdown` scheme and the tagging workflow can be found at [http://maximromanov.github.io/mARkdown/](http://maximromanov.github.io/mARkdown/). When manual tagging is complete our texts will be converted into a CTS-compliant XML format.\r\n\r\nPlease, check GitHub for more details: [https://github.com/OpenArabic/Annotation/](https://github.com/OpenArabic/Annotation/)",
