## General Description

The goal of the project is to build a machine-actionable corpus of premodern texts in Arabic to encourage computational analysis of Arabic literary tradition. Currently, most of the text are historical texts (chronicles, biographical collections, geographical treatises and gazetteers, thematic dictionaries); if you are interested in having other genres and forms, please, get in touch with us.

Most of the texts are coming from open online collections of premodern and modern Arabic texts, such as [http://shamela.ws/](http://shamela.ws/) and [http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/](http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/) (These texts have `Shamela+NUMBER` and `Shia+NUMBER`; some texts are coming from _al-Jāmiʿ al-kabīr_, which has been published on an external HDD and is not available online (`JK+NUMBER`). Initial metadata from these collections is preserved in the beginning of each file.

Currently uploaded have been automatically converted from their initial formats into `mARkdown` format—a flavor of `markdown` for tagging premodern Arabic text; they all require further editing, so that the structure of each text is tagged properly; the detailed description of `mARkdown` scheme and the tagging workflow can be found [http://maximromanov.github.io/mARkdown/](http://maximromanov.github.io/mARkdown/). When manual tagging is complete text will be converted into CTS-compliant XML format.

For the list of added books, see below (Mostly premodern chronicles, biographical collections, encyclopaedic dictionaries, gazetteers).
