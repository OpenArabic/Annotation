## Possible issues

- some texts are split into sections and those sections should be joined together
- *Shamela texts*: it is possible that some texts are *over-cleaned*. I noticed this issue with Rašīd Riḍá’s *al-Manār*, where `footnote` tags were used in the beginning of the page with text; it is possible that other texts have similar issue.
