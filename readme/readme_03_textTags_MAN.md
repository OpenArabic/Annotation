## Text Description Tags

Tags follow the URI of a text in the following format `(TAGS: TAG,TAG,TAG)`. Combinations of tags specify the description of the text, for example, `BIO` refers to 'a biographical text', but `BIO,COL` refers more specifically to 'a biographical collection'. 

*****************************
* `BIB` : bibliographical
* `BIO` : biographical
* `CHR` : chronicle
* `COL` : collection, dictionary, anthology
* `GEN` : genealogical
* `GEO` : geographical
* `ONO` : onomastic
* `HAD` : hadith

*****************************
* `SHC` : a Šīʿī text

*****************************
* `DHB` : ‘al-Ḏahabī Corpus’—his sources _&_ his books 
* `ORPHAN` : _no text_, orphan

**NB**: Title descriptions also have temporary tags (they start with `_`, an undescore), which are generated and updated automatically from the initial metadata. These tags are usefully suggestive, but not entirely reliable.

Based on temporary tags derived from The Coverage of the Arabic Collection: The detailed statistics can be found at [https://github.com/OpenArabic/Annotation], in Sections: “Chronological Distribution of Texts” and “Forms, Themes, Genres (provisional assessment)” [The detailed statistics can be found at https://github.com/OpenArabic/Annotation, in Sections: “Chronological Distribution of Texts” and “Forms, Themes, Genres (provisional assessment)”. Descriptive statistics numbers for “Forms, Themes, Genres (provisional assessment)” are overlapping as most books belong to multiple forms and genres, and often cover multiple themes.]. Descriptive statistics numbers for “Forms, Themes, Genres (provisional assessment)” are overlapping as most books belong to multiple forms and genres, and often cover multiple themes. At the moment we have ca. 7,700 Arabic texts; we are most interested in a smaller subset of ca. 5,500 texts written before 1930 CE (the year 1350 of the Islamic lunar calendar). This selection of texts covers most thoroughly the period from the 9th till 16th century CE (250-700 titles and 30-90 million words per century), but also offers a decent coverage of 7th-8th and 17th-early 20th centuries. Based on our provisional assessment of this collection using metadata that we were able to gather together with texts, the thematic coverage is very broad and includes all major genres that flourished in the Arabic-Islamic written tradition: 

* The broad category of “fine literature”/belles-lettres (adab) includes ca. 600 texts (with over 50 million words); its subcategories cover such areas as ethics (aḫlāq: over 204 titles, 12 million words); rhetoric (balāġaŧ: 357 texts, 33,3 million words); poetic theory, or “science of versification” (ʿarūḍ: 9 texts, 1,9 million words); poetic collections (šiʿr, 196 texts with 8,6 million words, covering all major historical periods/regions: pre-Islamic, early Islamic, Umayyad, ʿAbbāsid, Andalusi, ʿUṯmānī/Ottoman); collections of sayings and proverbs (*amṯāl*: 15 text with 1,3 million words);

* Greek tradition, altogether 150 texts, with 2,4 million words, including philosophical (*falsafaŧ*) and natural sciences texts (93 texts, 4,9 million words). [These also include texts from “A Digital Corpus for Graeco-Arabic Studies” (http://www.graeco-arabic-studies.org/), which was funded by Mellon; their Arabic section includes 77 texts with ca. 1 million words.]

**NB**: These categories based on the currently available metadata; creating detailed metadata on authors and their books, by the end of the project we will provide a very detailed and precise description of the coverage of this collection.
