## Text Description Tags

Tags follow the URI of a text in the following format `(TAGS: TAG,TAG,TAG)`. Combinations of tags specify the description of the text, for example, `BIO` refers to 'a biographical text', but `BIO,COL` refers more specifically to 'a biographical collection'. 

*****************************
* `BIB` : bibliographical
* `BIO` : biographical
* `CHR` : chronicle
* `COL` : collection, dictionary, anthology
* `GEN` : genealogical
* `GEO` : geographical
* `ONO` : onomastic
* `HAD` : hadith

*****************************
* `SHC` : a Šīʿī text

*****************************
* `DHB` : ‘al-Ḏahabī Corpus’—his sources _&_ his books 
* `ORPHAN` : _no text_, orphan

*****************************
**NB**: Title descriptions also have temporary tags (they start with `_`, an undescore), which are generated and updated automatically from the initial metadata. These tags are usefully suggestive, but not entirely reliable.

## Preliminary Analysis of Categories of Texts

Based on temporary tags derived from *The Coverage of the Arabic Collection* (the detailed statistics can be found at [https://github.com/OpenArabic/Annotation], in Sections: “Chronological Distribution of Texts” and “Forms, Themes, Genres (provisional assessment)”. Descriptive statistics numbers for “Forms, Themes, Genres (provisional assessment)” are overlapping as most books belong to multiple forms/genres/categories, and often cover multiple themes. At the moment we have ca. 7,700 Arabic texts with a smaller subset of ca. 5,500 texts written before 1930 CE (the year 1350 of the Islamic lunar calendar). This selection of texts covers most thoroughly the period from the 9^th^ till 16^th^ century CE (250-700 titles and 30-90 million words per century), but also offers a decent coverage of 7^th^-8^th^ and 17^th^-early 20^th^ centuries. Based on our provisional assessment of this collection using metadata that we were able to gather together with texts, the thematic coverage is quite broad broad and includes all major genres that flourished in the Arabic-Islamic written tradition: 

* The broad category of “fine literature”/belles-lettres (*adab*) includes ca. 600 texts, with over 50 million words; its subcategories—also quite broadly defined—cover such areas as “ethics,” (*aḫlāq*)—204 titles, with 12 million words; rhetoric (*balāġaŧ*)—357 texts, with 33,3 million words; poetic theory, or “science of versification” (*ʿarūḍ*)—9 texts, with 1,9 million words; poetic collections (*šiʿr*)—196 texts with 8,6 million words (collections of poetry, *dīwān*s, cover all major historical periods/regions: pre-Islamic, early Islamic, Umayyad, ʿAbbāsid, Andalusi, ʿUṯmānī/Ottoman); collections of sayings and proverbs (*amṯāl*)—15 texts, with 1,3 million words;

* Doxographical texts: “religious communities” (*milal*)—230 texts, 12,7 million words; “religious divisions” (*firaq*)—19 texts, 2 million words; refutations (*rudūd*)—65 texts, 4,1 million words;
* Medical texts (*ṭibb*), including both Greek and Islamic traditions—77 texts, with 5,2 million words; (**NB**: Including a collection of texts prepared by Professor Peter Pormann and his team at U Manchester within the “Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms” project—64 texts, with *ca.* 1 million words);
* Texts by smaller religious communities: Twelver Shiʿites—58 texts, 5,3 million words; Zaydī Shiʿites—5 texts, *ca.* 85,000 words); Ṣūfī texts—9 texts, 2,4 million words; 
* Greek/Hellenistic tradition—altogether 150 texts, with 2,4 million words, including philosophical (*falsafaŧ*) and natural sciences texts—93 texts, 4,9 million words (**NB**: Including texts from “A Digital Corpus for Graeco-Arabic Studies” (http://www.graeco-arabic-studies.org/), whose Arabic section includes 77 texts, with *ca.* 1 million words);

* Memoires (*muḏakkarāt*)—11 texts, *ca.* 1 million words; 
* Reference books of different kind: technical terminology of various disciplines (*muṣṭalaḥāt*)—224 texts, 31,9 million words; 

**NB**: These categories based on the currently available metadata; creating detailed metadata on authors and their books, by the end of the project we will provide a very detailed and precise description of the coverage of this collection.
