## Folder structure

- everything is divided into centuries
- each century includes `data` folder
- `data` folder includes `author` folders
- `author` folders include `title` folders
- `title` folders include:
	- texts (often different versions)
	- `arc` folder, where zipped texts are preserved in their pre-formatted form
	- `PDF` folder, which include:
		- **urls.txt** with links to PDFs (for about 125 books), mostly on [archive.org](archive.org)), which can be downloaded with `wget -i urls.txt` (on 'command line' or 'Terminal')
			- on Mac/Linux all PDFs can be also downloaded with `make` command
			- `wget` must be installed on Windows (Macs usually have it)
		- to save space, PDFs are ignored in this GitHub repositories 
		- if you find new PDFs, add urls (one per line) into a new file **urls_additional.txt**. PDFs can be found via Google, most commonly on the following websites:
			- [http://waqfeya.com/](http://waqfeya.com/), with most links lead to [archive.org](archive.org)); other useful sites are:
			- [http://kt-b.com/](http://kt-b.com/) (books are often bulked into large collections, but the selection seems to be larger than on [http://waqfeya.com/](http://waqfeya.com/));
			- [http://bib-alex.com/](http://bib-alex.com/), which has scanned books from the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (unfortunately, most files are stored on file-sharing services and lots of links are already dead)
			- [http://wqf.me/](http://wqf.me/) for manuscripts (search is rather complicated though); most links lead to [archive.org](archive.org) as well.

**Adding PDFs:** Ideally, we need to start collecting PDFs on which our texts are based and rename them according to some clear pattern that will be appendable to the URI scheme: + `_EditorName_Edition_Place_YEAR_XXX.pdff`, where `XXX` is the ordinal number of a volume (prepending zeros) and the extension is changed to `.pdff` since by default `*.pdf` files are excluded from repositories.
